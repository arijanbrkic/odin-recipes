        <h2>Amazing fried rice with chicken breast and assorted vegetables</h2>
        <p>Are you looking for another healthy dinner option for you and your family? This stir fry is a fan 
            favorite in my household. Easily customizable if you would like, substitute the brown rice for any
            other style of rice, choose and mix assorted vegetables, and even substitute the chicken for any 
            other protein.
